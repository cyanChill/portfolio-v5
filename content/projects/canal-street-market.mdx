This is a site I made for Frontend Practice's [Canal Street Market](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/canal-street-market) project. The goal is to recreate this unique layout, its hover animations, typography choices, and more.

## What's the Goal of this Site?

The main goal of creating this site is to improve my front end skills by trying to implement interesting animations and layout. From the site that this project is based upon, I found the overall navigation to be pretty cool an ingenious.
