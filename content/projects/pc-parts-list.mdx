<MdxNotice>
  Although I'm not hosting this application, you can compare my demo video to
  its inspiration, [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/).
</MdxNotice>

This is an application that I made for The Odin Project's [Inventory Application Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) for their Node.js course. The overall goal is to create an application entirely in Node.js (using a template engine) utilizing some database to store items and categories and providing CRUD methods.

## What's the Goal of this Application?

The main goal of this application is to provide a way for users to plan out their PC builds by allowing them to create a list to act as a guide. Users can look through the vast library of PC components to help create their build. If the component doesn't exist, the user can simply add it to our database. Our application also displays PC lists made by other users such that you can get inspired from them. In addition, next to each PC component in the build list is a link to a search on Amazon where the user can try and find the PC component to purchase.

## Features

Everyday users will have the ability to:

- Create PC build lists and update & delete the ones you created.
- View PC build lists made by other users.
- Add manufacturers and products to our PC parts database.

Admin users will have the ability to:

- Update & delete any builds using the admin password.
- Add, update, and delete categories to organize the PC parts.
- Delete manufacturers.
- Update & delete products.

## Building the Application

### Setup

I utilized [`express-generator`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) as a template to build my project. I decided to replace `EJS` with `Pug` due to using it in previous assignments provided by The Odin Project and wanting to familiarize myself with it more. To store the bulk of the data my application would have, I utilized `MongoDB` to store the text-content (PC lists, brands, items, categories) and `Multer` to store images locally (hence why this application isn't being hosted). For MongoDB, I utilized `Mongoose` as an interface to easily interact with the database.

### Challenge 1: Saving PC Build Components When Adding Parts

The first challenge that I faced was figuring out how I would "remember" a build list that the user is currently working on. How I would normally do this if working in HTML or React is to utilize local storage. The problem is that that doesn't exist in Node.js as the Window object doesn't exist. My initial solution was to use the `node-localstorage` package, however the package relies on a file to be created to mimic local storage.

I then turned to the alternative of utilizing cookies, which is something supported natively with Express and like with local storage, can be used to store data.

### Mongoose

Something that I learned more about during the process of creating this application is the capabilities of Mongoose, the interface used to interact with MongoDB. I knew from the past of advantages such as being able to call directly on a schema object to do our querying along with defining the schema in our files. Something I learned was the ability to create virtual properties which don't exist on the database but are created on our server. In addition, I learned that when we define relations between objects in different schemas through their "id", we can replace/populate that "id" value with the actual schema object it's associated with. This helps reduce the overall calls to the database by doing what would be done in 2 different database calls into 1.

### Challenge 2: Allowing Users to Update or Delete a PC Build List They Created

As part of the CRUD operations, we want to give users the ability to manipulate their own PC build lists. This means we need to figure out a way to make sure that a build can only be updated or deleted by its creator. The solution I landed upon is to add a password field when the user creates a build. This is something the user will need to remember to update or delete their builds. When someone views an individual build, there'll be buttons to update or delete, both requiring a password to go further.

Then come the other issue is how we would handle updating a build since it follows a similar logic to creating a build, and we would need to make sure we can update the build without the need to re-entering the password every time we want to update a component. I kind of answered my own question, but I ended up using cookies to do this.

## Improving the Application

### Improvement 1: Adding Image Upload

Up to this point, how we handled images provided to us for build images and product images are through URLs the user provides (from images on the web). To fix this issue, adding image upload would be greatly beneficial for the user experience. To do this, we'll be using [`Multer`](https://github.com/expressjs/multer), which is primarily used for uploading files. All that's needed is the following code to set up Multer:

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require("uuid");
// Multer Logic
const multer = require("multer");
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, "./public/data/uploads");
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${uuidv4()}.${file.mimetype.split("/")[1]}`);
  },
});

exports.upload = multer({ storage: storage });
```

To upload an image, we use a middleware where we specify the key in the form data containing the image data (in our case, it's "img"):

```javascript
upload.single("img");
```

But this isn't as far as we can go. We can go further by improving the image format that's stored on our server. The `.webp` image format provides an equally impressive quality compared to `.png` at a smaller size. To do this, we need to change our logic a bit. Instead of instantly storing the image to our server through our middleware, we want to store the image in memory. The code from earlier is now replaced with:

```javascript
// Multer Logic
const multer = require("multer");
// Save file data into buffer instead of creating it (for efficiency)
exports.upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });
```

We then require an external library, in our case, `ffmpeg` to do the image conversion for us.

### Improvement 2: Adding Some PWA Features

PWA stands for "Progressive Web Apps" and is a type of application built to work on both mobile and desktop devices. This may include adding features such as using the device's camera, accessing their storage for uploads, or location data if our application requires it. One of the additional features of PWA includes some offline support. With offline support, I can see some possibilities of where this can be useful. We can cache build lists, product pages, etc. once we visit them.

What we use to enable PWA features is [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/). To add some offline support to our application, we need to use **service workers**. Giving functionality to these service workers is made simple by using Workbox.

- The `pwa.js` file does the registering of the service worker with the functionality found in the `service-worker.js`.
- A good resource to get into PWA is found from Google's [web.dev docs](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/).

## Overall Learnings

1. Creating an application entirely in Node.js using a template engine to handle the front end.
2. Mongoose's feature of creating virtuals to create properties that don't exist on the database but are available to the server.
3. Mongoose's feature to populate relations between tables.
4. Getting familiar with Multer with storing images in memory instead of directly to disk.
5. Learning how we could convert images using ffmpeg.
6. Using Workbox to add caching to our application for offline support & PWA features.
