This is the fifth iteration of my portfolio in a little over 2 years (as of June 19, 2023). Progressively after each iteration, I learned more and more about web development as I picked up more technologies.

## Portfolio History

My first portfolio from June 17, 2021 was pretty scrappy and built entirely in plain HTML & CSS for a summer course I was taking at the time. This was really the deciding factor on what I wanted to pursue in computer science and led me to self-explore resources to improve my skills in web development - particularly by starting with freeCodeCamp's web-related courses.

A few months later, I learned React's class components from freeCodeCamp's "Front End Development Libraries" course and wanted to put that knowledge into practice by creating a portfolio site using it. Compared to my first portfolio, my second portfolio had separate pages along with some "data fetching" from a JSON file in a separate repository. I also had a search bar on the "Projects" page to help search through the projects I had listed.

> Unfortunately, I deleted the repository that acted as the "API" for this portfolio, so it's non-functional.

A little over a year after making my second portfolio, I decided to make a new portfolio with the knowledge I learned since then, which I made using React's functional components. It's **[currently hosted on Netlify](https://cyanchill.netlify.app/)** and displays some of the projects that I worked on. I went back to a single-page portfolio website and learned how to make a carousel along with using Netlify Forms to create a functional contact page which would send me an email.

A month after the third portfolio, I wanted to make another portfolio, but this time, using Next.js and a design of my own imagination. I envisioned the look of my portfolio to be like a screen of a camera, however, looking back from today, my implementation of it was poor and unprofessional looking. I did learn a lot during the process of making this portfolio such as learning how to implement page transition animations using Next.js along with implementing a blog with a CMS with `tinymce` and `prismjs`.

> This was previously hosted on Netlify and used Netlify Forms to handle the contact page. I recently reverted to using my v3 portfolio.

## Current Portfolio

This portfolio led me to learn a lot of new technologies and compose them together to create this nice portfolio.

### Figma Design

For this portfolio, I utilized a different process which was mainly starting off with a Figma design before coding. I looked at some good portfolio designs and took the ideas I liked and combined them to create this current result. Creating a Figma design file to base my portfolio design off was beneficial as it allowed me to have a clear idea of what I want (unlike with the fourth iteration of my portfolio).

> The Figma design file can be found [here in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyanChill/cyanchill.com/tree/main/design/portfolio-v5-design.fig).

#### Making Project Mockups

With my project, I wanted to create project mockups that looked "professional" to be displayed in the "projects" section of my portfolio. In my Figma mockups, I had some project mockups made by other developers that I wanted to replicate. I found some resources that helped me do this:

1. [Screely](https://screely.com/) creates good looking browser screenshots.
2. [Dimmy.club](https://dimmy.club/) creates simple device mockups.
3. [Device Frames](https://deviceframes.com/) creates nice looking 3D device mockups.

### Next.js 13 App Router

This is the first project that I've done which uses Next.js 13's new App Router. One of the main differences from the Pages Router is that we use the `app` folder instead of the `pages` folder. This was a new learning experience as I had to learn some of React's new features such as client & server components along with the new way Next.js structures files and pages.

#### Server & Client Components

With client & server components, the concept was "simple". Server components are components where we can write server code directly and not worry about it being shown to the client. This feature wasn't used much in this portfolio, but I see how it can be helpful for having initial data on pages once we visit them. Another benefit is that it'll be pre-rendered for faster loads. The downside is that we can't have any "interactive" elements such as buttons, forms, and React state. Client components be denoted with a `"use client"` at the top of the file. These are what we typically used in previous versions of Next.js & React. In these components, we have all the interactive methods such as React state. One thing with how Next.js handles client components is that it'll be pre-rendered on the server and hydrated on the client, which is good for speed.

##### Early Adopter Problems

There are some gripes that I have with Next.js App Router which are documented, but not fixed as of the time of writing. One of these gripes is how Next.js handles page metadata. Previously in the Pages Router, it's done by using the special `<Head />` component. Now, all we have to do is export a `metadata` object in the `pages.tsx` file (how we create page routes in App Router) and provide key-value pairs for each metadata we want in the `<head />` component. This is a nice idea as it simplifies the process of changing page metadata. The problem is more of how consistently it's implemented.

- The `metadata` object **only works in server components**. This means if the page route is a client component, we'll get the default browser behavior. So, if we have a page at route `/client/client-component`, the page title would look like `cyanchill.com/client/client-component`.
  - This can be fixed by exporting the main client component logic into a separate client component file, making the page route file a server component, and then importing the client component logic and inserting it into the returning JSX.
- With non-existent pages, which are caught by the new `not-found.tsx` file (previously `404.tsx` in the Pages Router), it doesn't consistently display the page metadata.
  - For pages where we display the `not-found.tsx` file with the `notFound()` function, we get the metadata as expected.
  - However, if we go to `cyanchill.com/non-existent`, we'll get no page metadata and a page title of `cyanchill.com/non-existent` will be displayed.

#### File Organization

Since this is a pretty new concept, where we should lay out our server & client components is something that needs exploring. With the App Router, only specific files will be displayed as our page routes, so we don't need to worry if we put other component files within the `app` folder. Currently, I decided to have my server pages components live in the `app` folder and the client components used by them in the `components` folder with the naming scheme of `<page-name>-<what it represents>.tsx`. For components that can be generally used anywhere, I used the typical CamelCase.

- This will be talked about later, but for the components used in my `.mdx` files, I name them as `mdx-<component name>.tsx`.

### React Hook Form

This is a library that makes dealing with forms in React easier. I'm glad that I learned about this library as it makes handling form state and in conjunction with **Zod**, a validation library, makes handling validation a breeze.

With **Zod**, we can create the following schema to create validation for our form fields and provide a custom error message that can be displayed.

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";

export const contactSchema = z
  .object({
    Name: z
      .string()
      .trim()
      .max(150, { message: "⚠️ Name can be at most 150 characters long." })
      .nonempty({ message: "⚠️ Name must be non-empty." }),
    Email: z
      .string()
      .trim()
      .email({ message: "⚠️ Email must be valid." })
      .nonempty({ message: "⚠️ Email must be non-empty." }),
    Message: z
      .string()
      .trim()
      .max(1000, { message: "⚠️ Message can be at most 1000 characters long." })
      .nonempty({ message: "⚠️ Message must be non-empty." }),
  })
  .strict()
  .required();
export type ContactSchemaType = z.infer<typeof contactSchema>;
```

To use **React Hook Form** in my contact form and have validation, I simply need to have:

```javascript
const { register, handleSubmit, reset, formState } =
  useForm < ContactSchemaType > { resolver: zodResolver(contactSchema) };
```

- `register()` is used to register input fields with **React Hook Form**.
- `handleSubmit()` wraps our `onSubmit` function that we provide to the `<form />` element.
- `reset()` is a function that clears our input fields.
- `formState` is an object where we can access our errors through `formState.errors`.

### Project Overview Posts / MDX

#### Learning How To Use MDX

Markdown itself is a concept I'm familiar with. MDX however was something relatively new for me and is something I wished I learned sooner. MDX is essentially Markdown, however, we can have React components in it. This would have made making the blog posts in the previous portfolio easier as I don't necessarily need to have a CMS as I don't really upload blog posts as frequently.

#### Contentlayer

This is a library that allows us to display MDX content in Next.js as a component. The difficult part of this library is setting up the configurations. There are third-party libraries that add customizability to Contentlayer such as having better looking code blocks along with linkable headers. The `.mdx` files will live in a subfolder within `content` folder that denotes its general content. Once we deploy our app in either development or production, Contentlayer will compile the MDX files into type-safe JSON data that can be displayed in a component.

#### Making Project Overview Write-ups

This was the most time-consuming part of creating this portfolio as I had to go through each of my projects and look at my old processes and the challenges that I faced in the past.

### Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)

Since I decided early on that I wanted to host my project on Vercel (mainly due to having the ability to have page analytics), I needed some alternative to having a contact form as previously, I used Netlify Forms to do this. This led me to look into Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to handle my contact form. The overall documentation didn't provide all the details on how to send emails through a back-end route, but I managed to figure it out.

Amazon's documentation stated we only needed the `@aws-sdk/client-ses` library, however, I found that I also needed the `aws-crt` library as well. Something that wasn't mentioned is that we needed some environment variables in order to get things working, specifically `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, which can be seen in the `.env.example` file.

Overall, the logic is pretty simple as to send an email through our back-end route, we just need:

```javascript
// Prevent injection
const message = `From: ${Name} (${Email})\n\n${Message}`
  .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
  .replace(/>/g, "&gt;");

const command = new SendEmailCommand({
  Source: "anthonyliang9@gmail.com",
  Destination: { ToAddresses: ["anthonyliang9@gmail.com"] },
  Message: {
    Subject: { Data: `Portfolio Contact Message : ${Email}` },
    Body: { Text: { Data: message } },
  },
});
await new SESClient({ region: "us-east-2" }).send(command);
```

With how I have things set up currently, when we do send an email through this way, the email will have a warning about it being a **spoofed message**, which is 100% accurate. This is generally fine for my use case.

### Upstash For Rate Limiting Contact Form

Since I'm aware of the horror stories of people racking up fees on AWS services. To make sure this doesn't happen to me, I decided to add a rate-limiter on the API route for my contact form as that's the only place where I interact with AWS. For this, I used Upstash and created a Redis database on it. Implementing a rate-limiter is pretty simple as we need to first create the limiter:

```javascript
// Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 3 requests per day
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(3, "1 d"),
  analytics: true,
  /**
   * Optional prefix for the keys used in redis. This is useful if you want to share a redis
   * instance with other applications and want to avoid key collisions. The default prefix is
   * "@upstash/ratelimit"
   */
  prefix: "@upstash/ratelimit",
});
```

And then utilize it:

```javascript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const ip = request.ip ?? "127.0.0.1";

  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);
  if (!success) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "You can only send 3 contact messages a day." },
      { status: 429 }
    );
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Hosting (Namecheap + Vercel)

For something like my portfolio site, I wanted to move away from a "free" domain such as Netlify and Vercel and get my own domain to make it look more professional. For getting my domain, I decided to use Namecheap. One of the more difficult decisions was deciding what domain to buy as `anthonyliang.com` was recently purchased and other domains extensions such as `.dev` and `.me` are a bit expensive for what it's worth. I ended up deciding to go with my GitHub username as my domain as it's short, unique, and easy to spell, which is a factor when verbally redirecting someone to your portfolio site.

I alluded earlier that I wanted to host my project on Vercel with a custom domain. This required some configuring on Namecheap's end which required changing the **NAMESERVERS** option for our domain from `Namecheap BasicDNS` to `Custom DNS` and putting in the nameservers Vercel provided when adding a custom domain to a project.

## Potential Future Updates

### Creating A Blog Section

This would be pretty simple to add since we utilized Contentlayer to host MDX files - we just need to update our configurations and create a new "document type". For now, I don't see much of a need to create one as I haven't been writing them on my v4 portfolio. If I do want to add one, I would like to figure out how I could have it on subdomain such as `blog.cyanchill.com`.
