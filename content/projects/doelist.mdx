This is an application that I made for The Odin Project's [Todo List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) project for their JavaScript course. This acted an early project in our JavaScript learning experience where we learned how to use Webpack. The goal was to create an application to hold a list of todos.
