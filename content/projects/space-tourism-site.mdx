This is a site I made for Frontend Mentor's [Space tourism multi-page website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). The goal is to recreate this website in any approach we want, recreate the animations, and provide optimal layouts for each screen size.
