<MdxNotice>
  The back end of this application may take some time to get up and running due
  to a cold start from running on free providers.
</MdxNotice>

This is an application that I made for my senior project which spanned over 2 semesters (September - May), which was broken up into 2 phases. The first phase (September - December) was the planning process and coming up with the idea. The second phase (December - May) consisted of bringing the application to life.

<a href="#demo-video">Skip to Demo Video</a>

## Motivation

Coming into this project, I lacked ideas for what I wanted to create. For inspiration, I searched the web to find some, but was sorely disappointed. What I found was just articles upon articles consisting of essentially the same information or projects that didn't meet my criteria - create an Amazon clone, an ecommerce website, a portfolio website, a to-do list app, and so on. The alternative that I found was GitHub's "Explore" feature which organized repositories by their topics. The problem with this is that you can only search by 1 topic at a time - there's no clear way to search by multiple topics. For example, when you open the "Front end" topic, the first result that shows up is "facebook/react", which is uninspiring for what I wanted. There was also GitHub's "Advanced search" option, which does better as there's more search options, however, there's still no option to search by multiple topics. This brings up another problem as not all repositories have topics associated with them, so the search by topics may miss some results that could be helpful.

## Solution

My application aims to fix this problem; however, it requires the help of developers to keep this idea afloat. The general concept is to **have developers suggest repositories and label them accordingly which will be stored in my database**. I decided on this route as even if I manage to use GitHub's API to allow search through multiple topics, the results will still be suboptimal as there'll be useless results. The **benefit of starting from scratch is that each repository that gets added to our database is vetted by a developer to be useful to the searcher given the labels assigned to it**. There's an additional benefit, which is that it can highlight repositories that are potentially abandoned and either redirect users to an alternative or get someone to pick it up. All these suggested repositories will be easily accessible through a simple interface that allows precision filtering through these suggested repositories.

In addition to having the feature of displaying repositories "suggested" by developers, I also want to provide an option similar to GitHub's "Advanced search" feature built-in to my application such that the user doesn't need to have multiple tabs open to accomplish the same task. My version of "Advanced search" will be slightly toned down, but comparable to the original as it'll allow users to filter repositories by stars and languages.

One problem that I foresee is that due to having developers suggest repositories, the potential for abuse arises. I plan to solve this by first only allowing access to suggesting repositories through authenticated user which will be handled through GitHub login. Second, only users whose GitHub account age is over 3 months old can suggest repositories. To keep allow for expandability and better filtering, users whose GitHub account age is over 1 year old can suggest "tags" that'll be used to label repositories and what I'll be using to create these filtered searches.

## Features

Everyday users will have the ability to:

- Search for random repositories given filters the user provides.
- Search from our database of "suggested" repositories labeled with multiple tags that fit the user's criteria using filters.
- Log into our application using their GitHub account.

Authenticated users that are >3 months old have the ability to:

- Contribute to the application by "suggesting" repositories and labeling them accordingly.

Authenticated users that are >1 year old have the ability to:

- Contribute to the application by "suggesting" "tags" that can be used to better label the repositories suggested by other users.

## Planning Phase (September 2022 - December 2022)

For the planning phase, I had to submit 2 proposals. The first proposal was to come up with a general idea and outlined some potential technologies that could be used to implement our idea. The second proposal was to finalize the proposal and provide some mockup ideas for our application so that I have a starting point for when I start coding.

### Proposal 1

Most of what I've said in the motivation and solution will be repeated here. For technologies, I planned on using the GitHub REST API to validate the repositories that are being suggested to our application exist. In addition, I planned on using TypeScript with React or Next.js as the general front-end framework and Python with Flask for the backend. At this point, I didn't write down the idea for handling authentication, but I would plan on using a third-party library to do this. I envisioned models for a "User" object, "Suggested Repository" object, and "Tags" object. I envisioned routes for authentication, querying repositories, and creating suggested repositories & tags.

I wanted to utilize Python & Flask instead of Node.js and Express for my back end because I wanted to become more flexible in what I can utilize in the back end and to have this project to act as a learning experience.

### Proposal 2

In this proposal, I "finalized" (this will end up changing) my general technology stack to be:

- Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for the front end.
- Flask, Python, Authlib, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy for the back end.

In addition, I created the following mockups for some pages and the models I expect to use:

    {

      alt: "Mockup of all the models I plan on using.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Implementation Phase (December 2022 - May 2023)

My process for creating this application is to first start on the back end and once that is mostly completed, I'll then work on the front end. What was new to me during this process was coding the back end in Flask & Python as I was more used to coding it in Node.js. From my proposals, the first thing I set off to do was plan out the routes and write out the models using SQLAlchemy as the interface. After getting that all sorted out, I wrote some files to help with populating the database with some test data.

### Challenge 1: Authentication

One of the potential challenges I saw was the implementation of authentication. To make things easier, I planned on using `Authlib` to handle OAuth with GitHub. After writing that code in the back end, I wanted to see if it worked with the client, so I created a quick Next.js app to test the auth route. To my surprise, it didn't work due to CORS and what I believed occurred was the fact that we're trying to log in on the server instead of that being sent to the client. I think utilizing `Authlib` would have worked if I built the app entirely in Flask.

Anyway, this route didn't work. Another plan was to handle authentication on our own and I found a solution through using the GitHub API directly through looking at GitHub's [Authorizing OAuth Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow) article and modifying the general workflow to suit my needs.

```python
  # Get temporary code from frontend
  code = request.json["code"]
  # Reduce calls to API by checking code length - at the time of writing,
  # the code is 20 characters long
  #   - Not sure if this number is fixed but 10 is a "safe" number
  #     of characters for invalid code length
  if len(code) < 10:
      raise Exception("Invalid code")
  # Get access token (ie: Returns "access_token=blahblahblahblah")
  acs_tk_resp = requests.post(
      "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
      data={
          "client_id": app.config["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"],
          "client_secret": app.config["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"],
          "code": code,
          "redirect_uri": app.config["GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI"],
      },
  )
  access_token = parse_qs(acs_tk_resp.text)["access_token"][0]

  # Get user data of authenticated user with their access token
  usr_dt_resp = requests.get(
      "https://api.github.com/user",
      headers={"Authorization": f"token {access_token}"},
  )
  github_user_data = usr_dt_resp.json()
```

The general code to handle authentication on our server went through a couple of iterations to make sure that:

- We create a "User" object if someone logs in and their GitHub account isn't associated with any user in our database.
- Fetch the "User" object from our database associated with the authenticated user.
- Create a way to "remember" the user when they make requests to our server through authenticated-routes.

For creating a way of "remembering" our user, I utilized the `Flask-JWT-Extended` library to set access & refresh cookies that'll be sent to the client. The advantage of using this library is the ability to have CSRF protection, which implements "double submit verification", which in layman's terms requires the client to send 2 cookies, 1 inaccessible and 1 accessible with JavaScript. The benefit of this approach is that attackers can't access the http-only cookie required for making requests.

After getting this all sorted out, I created a simple context on the front end such that we can access the user object once authenticated on the front end on any route and allow us to create functions to help create authenticated routes on the client.

### Challenge 2: Navigation UI (General UI Design in General)

After getting the authentication related tasks done, I started to work on the navigation bar on the front end modeled after what I had in my design. I didn't really like what I had in my initial design, and since I'm not really a designer, I looked at some ideas online. Since I was using TailwindCSS as the CSS framework for my project, I stumbled upon their paid component library [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/components). At the time of working on my project, they had some free components in which you could look at the code, however the "paid" components only allowed us to look at a png image. However, at the time of writing, they now have an interactive demonstration for all their components which allows us to see the design at different breakpoints.

### Challenge 3: GitHub "Advanced search" implementation

The actual implementation of this idea was straight forwards. All we had to do was accept some inputs and construct the [search query string from GitHub's REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-repositories). The main problem was the [rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limit) GitHub does when utilizing their REST API for search. They did provide, in their documentation, on [how we could increase the unauthenticated rate limit using our OAuth app secret](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-apps), however, they utilized `CURL` in their example, which is something I was a bit unfamiliar with.

After a bit of research and looking at the `Requests` python library documentation, I figured out that their `CURL` request example was equivalent to providing an "auth" value in the `Requests` library. For the given traffic I expect from my application as an MVP (minimum viable product), I found this to be enough.

```python
  # Will fetch up to 100 results for this "page" (allows pagination)
  request_url = f"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q={starsQuery}{langQuery}&per_page={limit}&sort=stars&order=asc"
  print(request_url)
  resp = requests.get(
      request_url,
      # Below does the "-u client_id:client_secret" in the CURL command
      auth=(app.config["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"], app.config["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"]),
      headers={
          "Accept": "application/vnd.github.text-match+json",
          "User-Agent": "gitinspire-server",
      },
  )
  data = resp.json()
```

> For future revisions for my application, I see the possibility of moving away from this in favor of directly using the user's personal access token obtained from our login-process instead of our OAuth secret in making these requests (whose rate limit is shared between **all users** of our application).

### Challenge 4: Contribute Page

This is the other core feature of our application, which is the ability to "suggest" repositories and label them. My main idea of the form was to work on a single-page and conditionally load the next page of the form based on the prior input (essentially whether we want to suggest a tag or a repository). This was ultimately solved by creating a hook that would allow this to occur.

```tsx
const { completed, currStep, isLastStep, next, back } = useMultistepForm([
  <ContributeTypeForm key="Step 1" handler={handleTypeSelection} />,
  data.formType === "tag" ? (
    <TagSuggForm key="Step 2" {...data} updateFields={updateField} />
  ) : (
    <RepoSuggForm key="Step 2" {...data} updateFields={updateField} />
  ),
  <ContributeSubmitForm key="Step 3" {...data} />,
]);
```

> My implementation for this logic in `contribute.tsx` is not the best code and the overall logic that handles this is confusing and I will redo it if I remake this application.

The backend logic was a bit ... involved. I somewhat made things more complicated for myself as I wanted the 1st language in the "Languages" array in the "Repository" object to be the most used language, but I didn't really do anything meaningful with it. Otherwise, I had to implement the general workflow idea (which was similar between suggesting Tags & suggesting Repositories):

1. Validate the user is allowed to make this request (look at their account age).
2. Validate & sanitize the inputs.
3. Verify the newly requested tag or repository doesn't already exist.
4. Temporary add the values into our database to create the relations in our models (specifically the languages for the repository).
5. Finally, the creation of the object.

### Challenge 5: Discover Page

My idea for this page was to make it "reusable". What I mean by "reusable" is that if we copy the URL in our browser for a given search, we should get similar results if we paste it again. To do this, I stored all the filter values (used for searching) in the URL query params. I won't be going in-depth with this implementation as I suboptimally used **useEffect** to accomplish this, which by React's doc, is bad practice.

For this page, I created the following mockups:

<ImageViewer
  images={[
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-4.webp",
      alt: "Initial layout of Discover page.",
    },
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-5.webp",
      alt: "Design of card that'll display information about the suggested repository.",
    },
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-6.webp",
      alt: "Combining the previous 2 mockups.",
    },
  ]}
/>

Implementing the back end to accomplish this task required a bit of thinking. From SQLAlchemy's documentation, we can continuously chain "actions" onto a query. The problem I faced was how I would implement filtering in our search by multiple languages or tags in the most optimal way. I saw that there was a `contains` query that could search from an array, but it does the `OR` operation instead of what I want, which is the `AND`. In the end, I settled with what I could see works, but may be potentially suboptimal which is chaining filters for each language independently as seen below:

```python
  if tags:
    # Stack filters such that entries that pass the filters have all the
    # specified tags via RepoTag relations
    for tag in tags:
        query = query.filter(Repository.tags.any(tag_name=tag))
```

### Writing Tests

Writing tests are tedious, but beneficial as they may catch bugs as we change our code. In a dynamically typed language where we can assign a value of any type to a variable, bugs can occur due to misassigning a value which would be caught if the variable is given a type. For the front end, this isn't needed as much due to using TypeScript, but for the back end, tests were necessary.

For the back end, I utilized `Pytest` along with `WebTest` to do unit & integration testing for my backend routes.

### Challenge 6: CI/CD

Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) is a very new concept for me and something I find intriguing. I understand CD, in which I see it every time I decide to host my applications on either Netlify or Vercel - when a build succeeds, we'll get a little checkmark next to the commit or an "X" if it failed.

Even though GitHub provides documentation for setting up CI, it's difficult to see whether it works or not until we commit the file and see it in action. This results in several (useless) commits in our commit history. Setting up this pipeline, however, is beneficial as it makes sure any commits made to our repository pass our tests and will automatically deploy the changes if they succeed.

### Challenge 7: "Refresh" feature

Since most of our data in our database relies on external data from the GitHub API, things are bound to become outdated or broken. To combat this, I decided to add a "refresh" feature which would be available once a day for every repository and user profile. The general workflow for accomplishing this is:

1. Check to see if what we're refreshing exists in our database.
2. Check to see if the content has been refreshed recently.
3. If the data hasn't been refreshed recently, we fetch the data from GitHub.
4. Handle any errors in the response accordingly. Otherwise, update the content in our database. For repositories, we go through the same process as suggesting a repository.

### More Designs

Since this didn't really fall anywhere else prior, here are some additional design and design changes that I made to what I had previously:

    },

      alt: "Unused redesign of Discover page filter menu.",
    },
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-10.webp",
      alt: "Another unused redesign of Discover page filter menu.",
    },
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-11.webp",
      alt: "Another unused redesign of Discover page filter menu (general concept used for Contribute form redesign).",
    },
    {
      url: "/projects/gitinspire/mockup-12.webp",
      alt: "Redesign of filter menu for Discover page.",
    },
  ]}
/>
